# Find-N-Shake Restaurants
Android app that finds random restaurants via the Yelp API. Made more fun by letting the user shake for the results.

## Functionality
* List X numbers of restaurants randomly upon shake or refresh.
* Filter restaurant search by zip code, distance, and category (e.g. Italian, American, Chinese, ect.).
* View details about the restaurant, including name, address, phone number, hours, Yelp user submitted images.
* For each restaurant, give the users instructions to the restaurant via Google Map API.

## Requirements
* Location services must be turned on. This is because our app relies on your current location to initially populate the restaurant list.

## Running the app in android studio:
* git clone https://github.com/jsunthon/RandomRestaurantFinder.git
* Open Android Studio
* File -> Open -> navigate to the directory of the cloned git repo, and open "RandomRestaurantFinder"
* If receiving message about unregistered VCS root, click "add".
